Based on a passage from Borges' short story Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, the proposed installation listens to speech in an area immediately under the device, strips all nouns and proper names from the data, then projects the words on an adjacent wall. As humanity holds the naming of things to be a factor which sets us apart from nature, the resultant text becomes a narrative of universal feeling rather than direct description. 

The python script relies on Alpha Cephi's Vosk package to do the work of generating text from speech. The resultant text is then scanned for nouns and proper names referenced from a wordlist. The resultant text is then printed to the screen in a sort of run on sentence of pure feeling and action rather than subjective ideation.
